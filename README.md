# Pride Fonts Emoji
A fork of the noto-emoji font that patches in more pride flags than default.

## Completed items
NOTE: The transgender, and rainbow flag are not patched in as most fonts include them.
  - Lesbian Flag
  - Bisexual Flag
  - Pansexual Flag
  - Asexual Flag
  - Non-Binary Flag
  - Gender-Queer Flag
  - Gender-Fluid Flag
  - Intersex Flag
  - Agender Flag
  - Aromantic Flag
  - Demisexual Flag
  - Greysexual Flag
  - Philadelphia Pride Flag
  - Polyamory Flag

## How it works
Basically since unicode controls everything, we have to remove other emojis and replace them. Sadly this removes other emojis, but we try to only remove
useless emojis that nobody uses so it wont be so bad.
